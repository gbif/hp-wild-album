(es) Wild Album highlights camera trap data published through the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org). It allows users to find data that might fit their need and allows datasets owners to make their research more discoverable. All data use is subject to the [GBIF user agreement](https://www.gbif.org/terms/data-user).

## (es) Scope

(es) Any dataset that is published as a [Camera Trap Data Package (Camtrap DP)](https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org) and is registered with GBIF is automatically included in Wild Album. Publication and registration can be do through e.g. a [GBIF IPT](https://www.gbif.org/ipt).

### (es) API access

## (es) How can you contribute?

(es) The best way to contribute to Wild Album is by publishing your camera trap data to GBIF. We hope to add more detailed instructions later, but see the [publication guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-0qzp-2x37) to get started.
